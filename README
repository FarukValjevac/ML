This is my public repository where I will provide (commented) codes which are important to understand ML basics. An EverNote with explanations of terms, workflows, methods etc. aswell as the instruction how to setup your environment can be accessed via the links provided below. Invest the time, it is worth it! :)  
NOTE: This is a summary of the Machine Learning Crash Course provided by Google. My intention is to take the most important things from the course for easy understanding without the unnecessary talk-around and without working with Google Colab.

Knowledge should be shared and easy accessible to everyone! Cheers

REQUIRED: 
I'm using PyCharm IDE with Anaconda environment. 
Install PycCharm and Anaconda Windows/Mac/Ubuntu:

REQUIRED:
For building and deploying ML models TensorFlow is required.
Install TensorFlow (OS independent): 
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/tensorflow/

OPTIONAL:
NumPy and Pandas can be installed directly from your IDE (usually) and a independent installation is not needed.
Anyways if you want to install it independently, feel free to do so.
Install NumPy (OS Independent):

Install pandas (OS Independent):
